# CityHenge 

The CityHenge visualization was developed originally as an idea to display the use of [VECKNIK](https://github.com/Vizzuality/VECNIK) with [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmaps.org) data. The map shows the sunset angle across New York City for every day of the year, allowing you to find [Manhattanhenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattanhenge) events year round.

### SOTMUS

The original presentation was given at the 2013 SOTMUS Conference. [Watch it here](vimeopro.com/openstreetmapus/state-of-the-map-us-2013/video/68096664).
